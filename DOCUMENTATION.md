# Self-documenting Documentation Slides

The markdeck documentation gets a major overhaul:
it gets rewritten as self-documenting slide decks!
That means that you can see the rendered slide and its source side-by-side.

* [the markdown basics](https://arnehilmann.github.io/markdeck/docs/markdown-basics/explain.html)
* [the slide layout](https://arnehilmann.github.io/markdeck/docs/slide-layout/explain.html)
* TODO: slide layout
* TODO: metadata
* TODO: asciiart

_You can find the old documentation [here](DOCUMENTATION-OLD.md)._
